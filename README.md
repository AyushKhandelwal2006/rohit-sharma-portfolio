Hello, I am Ayush Khandelwal, an undergraduate student from the Information Technology branch. I designed a modern, interactive sport portfolio website on rohit sharma built with a focus on clean UI, smooth animations.

A modern, responsive portfolio website dedicated to **Rohit Sharma**, showcasing his career, statistics, gallery, and achievements with an interactive user experience.
